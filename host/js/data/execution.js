Service spawning powershell -enc = potential persistence. svchost spawning powershell -enc = likely WMI-based execution.

        notes: "DOSfuscation exploits cmd.exe's quirky parsing rules - carets are escape characters, quoted empty strings are silently removed, commas and semicolons can substitute for spaces in certain positions. The result is command strings that look like noise but execute normally. The core reference is Daniel Bohannon's 2018 DEF CON talk and the Invoke-DOSfuscation tool. Detection angle: legitimate cmd.exe usage almost never contains 3+ consecutive carets or quoted null strings mid-token. These patterns have near-zero false-positive rate in normal enterprise telemetry - they're detectable because the obfuscation itself is anomalous. The deeper hunt is what the obfuscated command actually does: decode the outer shell (drop carets, remove quoted nulls, resolve env var substrings) and analyze the revealed payload. Kibana regex on CommandLine is more reliable than Sysmon config-level filtering here because Sysmon's XML match syntax doesn't support regex in CommandLine fields - this is one of the genuine cases where the Kibana column catches things the Sysmon column misses at config time.",

One important addition to the parent list vs the cmd/PS indicators: onenote.exe. Since the MOTW macro block in 2022, OneNote became a popular delivery vehicle - embedded attachments inside .one files execute via the OneNote process, not a standard Office app. Also worth noting: msaccess.exe and mspub.exe are lower-volume Office apps that get less scrutiny but are used in targeted operations specifically because defenders don't always include them in parent-process watchlists.

        notes: "This indicator represents the post-2022 evolution of VBScript delivery after Microsoft's macro block. The ISO container trick works because Windows auto-mounts ISO files when double-clicked (since Windows 8), and files inside the mounted ISO volume do not inherit the Zone.Identifier ADS from the outer ISO file - so the .vbs inside has no MOTW and runs without a macro security prompt. The detection pivot is twofold: first, the ISO mount event itself (MountPoints2 registry key, Sysmon EID 11 on the ISO), then wscript executing a script from a mounted drive letter or staging path. The drive-letter heuristic (wscript running D:\\something.vbs where D: is not a standard drive) is high-fidelity but requires knowing which drive letters are fixed vs removable vs mounted in your environment. The %TEMP% and %APPDATA% path heuristics are broader and catch the cases where the script is first dropped to disk before execution. VBE (.vbe) is encoded VBScript - the content is obfuscated using Microsoft's Script Encoder - and is a meaningful escalation signal when seen in these paths.",

        notes: "The detection pattern here is nearly identical to T1059.005 VBScript - same engines (wscript/cscript), same suspicious paths, same EID 11 supplementary hunt. The distinctions that matter: .js files have a user-visible double-click association on Windows (wscript runs them silently), making them effective for lure-based delivery without requiring a macro or container trick. The user sees what looks like a document icon, double-clicks, and wscript silently executes the payload. JSE (.jse) is encoded JScript using Microsoft's Script Encoder - same tool as VBE encoding - and is a stronger signal because legitimate software rarely produces .jse files in staging directories. Gootloader is worth calling out specifically because it uses an unusual pattern: a large multi-stage .js file (often 5,000+ lines of obfuscated code) that may be staged in the registry between stages rather than purely on disk - if you see wscript running a .js with an unusually large file size or see powershell.exe reading registry values and piping to wscript, that's a Gootloader indicator. False positives: some legitimate software installers use .js files during setup, typically from their own installation directory rather than temp paths - path context resolves most of these.",

Gootloader is the canonical example and worth understanding in depth: it uses SEO poisoning to rank malicious sites in search results for legal/business document searches, delivers a large obfuscated .js file disguised as the document, and relies entirely on the user double-clicking it. The browser parent variant is less common now because modern browsers (Chrome, Edge) warn before opening script files downloaded from the internet - but it still surfaces in environments with older browser configurations or where the .js is delivered inside a password-protected ZIP (bypasses browser warning because the file is 'opened' from the ZIP handler, not the browser directly).

There is no registry run key, no scheduled task XML, no startup folder file - the persistence object lives entirely inside the WMI repository binary (OBJECTS.DATA), which most IR tools and AV products do not inspect by default. Sysmon EID 19/20/21 are the primary detection mechanism and are only logged if Sysmon is deployed with WMI monitoring enabled in its config - verify your Sysmon config actually captures these before assuming you have coverage. The three-event chain (19 = filter registered, 20 = consumer registered, 21 = binding created) tells the complete story: what triggers it, what it does, and that it is now armed. In practice, EID 21 (binding) is the highest-value single alert because a filter and consumer registered independently are less meaningful than when they are bound together. Two consumer types are dangerous: CommandLineEventConsumer (runs a shell command) and ActiveScriptEventConsumer (runs VBScript or JScript inline - no file on disk at all). Legitimate WMI subscriptions exist (SCCM, some AV products) - baseline your environment before alerting on all subscription activity. The root\\subscription namespace is the canonical adversary location; legitimate subscriptions more often live under root\\cimv2 or vendor-specific namespaces.",

The schtasks.exe /create command is the most visible path - it generates Sysmon EID 1 with the full command line including the task action, which is often where the suspicious binary path or interpreter is visible. The detection is path-and-action focused: system binaries in standard paths (C:\\Windows\\System32) creating tasks that run system management tools are normal; tasks running interpreters (powershell, wscript, mshta) or binaries from user-writable paths (AppData, Temp, ProgramData) are suspicious. Security Event 4698 is the more comprehensive signal because it fires regardless of how the task was created - schtasks.exe, PowerShell COM API, or remote scheduling - and the event content includes the full task XML. The task XML file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\ is a valuable forensic artifact: it contains the full action, trigger, principal, and run-as context and persists even after the process that created it has exited. Adversaries frequently disguise task names as legitimate Windows tasks ('Windows Update', 'GoogleUpdateTask', 'AdobeFlashUpdate') - the action path is more reliable than the task name for detection.",

The two previous T1053.005 indicators cover real-time creation via schtasks.exe EID 1 and Security EID 4698. This one covers the scenario where a task was created by a method that didn't generate obvious telemetry (COM API, fileless stager, pre-Sysmon deployment) and you need to sweep for it. The Get-ScheduledTask PowerShell script and the raw XML scan of C:\\Windows\\System32\\Tasks\\ are the most useful live-host forensic tools for this. The svchost.exe spawning suspicious children pattern bridges the gap - it fires when an existing task actually executes, regardless of how it was created, because all modern scheduled tasks run under the Task Scheduler svchost instance. The parent command line containing 'Schedule' distinguishes the Task Scheduler svchost from the dozens of other svchost instances running on a Windows system. Adversaries frequently disguise task names as Windows Update, Windows Defender, Google Update, or similar legitimate-sounding names - always inspect the action path, not the task name, as the primary detection signal.",

System Event 7045 is the broader net: it fires regardless of whether sc.exe, PowerShell, or a compiled binary's API call was used to create the service. 7045 is underutilized in many detection stacks - it's in the System log rather than Security, so it sometimes gets overlooked in log collection policies. Worth verifying your SIEM is ingesting System log events, not just Security. The registry artifact is the most durable - even if the service was created and the creating process logs have rolled, the registry entry under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services persists until the service is explicitly deleted. Services with a blank Description, blank DisplayName, and an ImagePath in a user-writable directory are a high-confidence IOC combination. Adversaries sometimes use sc.exe create with start=demand followed immediately by sc.exe start - watch for that rapid create-then-start sequence in the same session as it indicates immediate execution intent rather than persistence setup.",

Seeing PSEXESVC originating from a developer workstation, a user endpoint, or targeting a domain controller is worth immediate investigation.

The key challenge is normalization: ImagePath values can be quoted, unquoted, contain environment variables (%SystemRoot%), or embed arguments after the binary path - the hunt script handles this. Environment variable expansion is important because %SystemRoot%\\system32\\svchost.exe is legitimate but looks non-standard if you string-match on C:\\Windows without expanding the variable first. Services running from C:\\ProgramData\\ deserve particular scrutiny - it's a world-writable directory that doesn't appear in standard path allowlists, making it a common adversary staging location. The services.exe parent filter in the Sysmon section is a useful real-time complement: services.exe is the SCM binary that directly spawns services, so filtering Sysmon EID 1 on ParentImage=services.exe and checking the child's path against standard directories gives live execution coverage for this indicator.",

The detection sweet spot is the argument: legitimate mshta usage almost never involves a URL or UNC path - HTAs in legitimate enterprise software are launched from local installed paths. A URL in the mshta command line is high-fidelity malicious in virtually all environments. The inline VBScript and JScript variants (`mshta.exe vbscript:...` and `mshta.exe javascript:...`) are even cleaner indicators because they require no remote fetch - the entire payload is on the command line. Worth pairing this indicator with parent process context: mshta spawned by an Office app, browser, or explorer.exe is a phishing chain; mshta spawned by a known IT management process is more likely legitimate. The network connection pivot (EID 3 from mshta) is useful for catching the fetch portion when the URL itself has been obfuscated in the command line.",

        notes: "The inline script variant (vbscript: / javascript: / jscript: protocol handlers) has near-zero legitimate use in modern enterprise environments. Unlike the URL variant where the false positive consideration is 'is this an internal HTA app being launched legitimately,' the inline form is almost exclusively an attacker convenience. The payload appears directly in the command line, which is both an opportunity and a challenge: opportunity because the full intent is visible in a single Sysmon event; challenge because the payload is often obfuscated with string concatenation, character codes, or chained CreateObject calls to defeat string matching. Detection should focus on the protocol handler keywords (vbscript:, javascript:, jscript:) rather than trying to pattern-match the payload itself. Once an alert fires, manual decoding of the command line reveals intent. Pair with child process analysis: inline mshta almost always spawns cmd.exe or powershell.exe as a follow-on stage.",

        notes: "Squiblydoo is one of the most well-documented LOLBin techniques and remains effective in environments where AppLocker or WDAC has not been specifically tuned to block regsvr32 with remote scriptlet arguments. The technique works because regsvr32.exe is Microsoft-signed, scrobj.dll is Microsoft-signed, and the inline scriptlet content runs inside regsvr32's process context - none of the default Application Whitelisting checks catch this chain. The detection is high-fidelity because legitimate regsvr32 usage virtually never involves the /i: flag with a URL or scrobj.dll. The classic pattern is so distinctive (URL + scrobj.dll in the same command line) that a single Sysmon EID 1 rule with no further tuning catches the vast majority of Squiblydoo invocations. Worth noting: AppLocker can be specifically configured to block this technique by denying regsvr32 outbound network access or denying scrobj.dll specifically - but most environments don't do this by default. The technique pre-dates ATT&CK itself and Casey Smith's 2016 disclosure remains the canonical reference.",

The three Sysmon event IDs here (1, 8, 10) are the best available host-side telemetry, but each has significant false-positive challenges that require careful tuning. EID 8 (CreateRemoteThread) is the most actionable: legitimate software rarely injects threads into other processes, and a CreateRemoteThread event where StartModule is blank almost always indicates shellcode rather than a legitimate DLL-based operation. EID 10 (ProcessAccess) with write-capable access masks is noisier - AV and EDR products themselves open handles to other processes for scanning, so source-image allowlisting is essential. The empty command line on EID 1 is worth monitoring but generates false positives from some legitimate system processes and certain vendor software that uses Win32 CreateProcess with a NULL lpCommandLine argument. The honest detection gap to acknowledge: the most sophisticated operators use direct syscalls (Syswhispers-style) to bypass even ntdll.dll, making user-mode detection insufficient. Kernel-mode ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) sensors in modern EDR products are the frontier for that level of evasion. For most environments and most adversaries, the Sysmon EID 8 blank-StartModule detection is the highest-value single alert in this indicator.",

Investigation pivots:
- The '(deleted)' or '/memfd:' image path is the highest-
  fidelity single indicator of fileless execution

- Linux process artifacts flagging deleted/memfd exe links`,
        notes: "This is the Linux counterpart to the Windows Native API row, and it centers on fileless execution via memfd_create - the dominant Linux EDR-evasion execution technique. The mechanism: memfd_create() creates an anonymous file that exists only in RAM, the payload (typically an ELF) is written to that file descriptor, and execve runs it directly - nothing ever touches disk, so file-based AV and integrity monitoring see nothing. The defining, highest-fidelity indicator is a process whose /proc/<pid>/exe symlink resolves to '/memfd:...' or shows '(deleted)' - that single check catches the overwhelming majority of fileless Linux execution and is trivially scriptable across /proc. Because syscall visibility is what really nails this, eBPF tooling (Falco, Tetragon, Tracee) is the strongest detector - they see the memfd_create and execve syscalls directly, before the exec resolves; auditd with memfd_create+execve rules is the next best and works without eBPF. Sysmon for Linux surfaces the resulting exec with a /memfd: image path. Critical IR note: the payload lives only in memory and vanishes when the process exits, so if you find one, capture the memfd content or process memory (gcore, /proc/<pid>/mem) immediately - there's no on-disk copy to recover later. This frequently pairs with a download step that deliberately left no file (curl piped straight into a memory loader), so correlate with network egress that has no matching file write.",

On a clean system this file should not exist at all - its mere presence is a critical indicator warranting immediate investigation. The LD_PRELOAD environment variable variant is more targeted: it affects only processes launched from the shell where the variable is set, making it less persistent but harder to detect because it leaves no on-disk configuration artifact beyond a shell config modification. The detection counter is /proc/<pid>/environ, which preserves each running process's environment - scanning all running processes for LD_PRELOAD pointing to non-standard paths catches active exploitation. For the Ebury/Windigo family specifically: it targets the libssl shared library, hooking authentication functions to capture SSH credentials in plaintext from every SSH connection the server processes. This is not just persistence - it is a credential harvesting mechanism that affects every user authenticating through the compromised server.

        notes: "DLL side-loading is conceptually distinct from DLL injection - in injection, the adversary runs code in an existing process via API calls. In side-loading, the adversary tricks a trusted process into loading a malicious DLL through the normal Windows DLL search order. The result is a fully-trusted-looking process running attacker code with the trusted binary's signature inheriting to the loaded DLL's behavior from a process-trust perspective. The detection pattern is path-and-signature focused: a signed executable in a user-writable directory loading an unsigned DLL from that same directory is the canonical side-load chain. False positives: some legitimate software does run from temp directories with bundled DLLs (installers, portable apps) - signature checking on both the executable and DLL helps, but signed installers may bundle their own signed DLLs that look legitimate. The strongest signal is the combination: signed EXE in user-writable path + adjacent unsigned DLL with a system-sounding name (version.dll, wininet.dll, dwmapi.dll). This pattern is heavily used by China-nexus operators - APT41, PlugX, ShadowPad all use it as standard tradecraft.",

        notes: "DLL Search Order Hijacking is the broader category that includes DLL Side-Loading - the previous indicator (side-loading) is the specific case where the adversary brings both a trusted executable and the malicious DLL together. This indicator covers the case where the adversary drops a malicious DLL with a system name into a directory that resolves earlier in the search order than System32, causing the application to load the malicious DLL by name. The detection focuses on common hijack target DLL names (version.dll, wininet.dll, dwmapi.dll, etc.) loaded from non-system paths. False positives are lower than you might expect because the search order is well-defined and legitimate applications generally don't redistribute these system-name DLLs - if you see wininet.dll loading from C:\\ProgramData\\some-app\\, that is almost certainly malicious. Detection complement: hijacklibs.net catalogs the most commonly-hijacked DLLs by name, which is a good starting allowlist/watchlist seed.

        notes: "User Execution: Malicious File is the technique that captures 'the user clicked the thing.' The detection is largely about path context: execution from a mounted ISO drive letter, from a temp ZIP extraction directory, or from the Downloads folder all indicate a recently-acquired file being launched by the user. The explorer.exe parent context is essential - it confirms the user manually launched the file rather than some automated process. ISO mounting is the most important post-2022 delivery vector to understand: Windows auto-mounts ISO files when double-clicked, and files inside the mounted volume don't inherit the Zone.Identifier ADS from the outer ISO file. This means the actual payload runs without the 'Mark of the Web' warning that would otherwise prompt the user. The detection should pair container mount evidence (MountPoints2 registry key) with subsequent process execution from the mounted drive letter. False positives: legitimate ISO usage (software installers, OS recovery media) exists but is rare on user endpoints. Build allowlists from baseline behavior of your environment. This indicator is the host-side complement to T1566 Phishing in the Initial Access tactic - the network reference covers the delivery; this covers the execution.",

        notes: "LNK files are the connective tissue of modern phishing delivery chains - particularly in ISO containers where the LNK provides the user-clickable interface while the actual payload (often a script or DLL) sits hidden in the same container. The detection focuses on the execution artifact rather than the LNK file itself: when a user double-clicks a malicious LNK, Sysmon EID 1 captures the resulting process spawn with explorer.exe as the parent and the LNK's target+arguments visible in the new process's command line. This is why the explorer.exe parent context combined with risky command-line arguments (ExecutionPolicy Bypass, EncodedCommand, vbscript:, URL fetches, suspicious paths) is so high-fidelity. The live-host LNK enumeration PowerShell script is useful for IR triage: it parses every LNK in the user profile and flags ones with suspicious targets/arguments. False positives: some legitimate software ships .lnk files in user paths (Quick Launch, custom shortcuts created by installers), and developer workflows sometimes involve LNK files with command-line arguments - context matters. The strongest single signal is a LNK file in Downloads, Desktop, or a temp ZIP extraction directory with a TargetPath of cmd/powershell/wscript and an Arguments field containing payload-like content.",

- A process whose /proc/<pid>/exe points to a deleted file

        notes: "Unix shell is the Linux analogue of the PowerShell/cmd execution rows on the Windows side, and the highest-volume execution surface on Linux. The single most valuable pattern to hunt is a shell spawned by a network-facing service (nginx, apache, php-fpm, tomcat, java, node) - that lineage almost always means a webshell or exploited RCE, exactly mirroring the Windows 'Office spawns powershell' logic. After that, the content patterns: curl|bash and wget|sh (download-pipe-execute), base64 -d piped to a shell (obfuscated payloads), and reverse-shell one-liners (bash -i >& /dev/tcp/.../..., nc -e, python -c socket). Telemetry: auditd execve logging is the foundation and should be enabled with a catch-all execve rule keyed for easy searching; Sysmon for Linux gives you the same EID 1 ProcessCreate model you already use on Windows, so the detection logic ports cleanly. Don't rely on shell history as a primary control - attackers routinely unset HISTFILE or truncate it, so treat history tampering itself as a signal. A process whose /proc/<pid>/exe link shows '(deleted)' is running a binary that was unlinked while executing - a strong fileless tell worth a dedicated check. For containerized Linux, Falco is the strongest runtime detector.

When you see httpd → bash or php-fpm → sh → wget in your process tree, you are looking at webshell execution or direct web vulnerability exploitation. The detection is straightforward to implement and extremely low false-positive: the parent process set (web workers) is small and well-defined, and any shell child is anomalous. Correlate with web access logs to identify the exploited endpoint: look for POST requests to small PHP files or unusual URL patterns in the seconds before the shell spawn. The CGI pattern (httpd directly spawning a shell) is less common on modern stacks but still appears on legacy systems. The modern pattern is php-fpm → dash → curl/wget/python, or java (Tomcat/Spring/Log4j) → sh → payload. Falco provides this detection as a built-in rule with near-zero tuning required.

Shell audit note:
  Even with HISTFILE=/dev/null, auditd execve log

  Auditd is the counter-move to history suppression.`,
        notes: "HISTFILE and shell history suppression is the single most consistent attacker behavior on interactive Linux shells - it is near-universal because it costs nothing and eliminates a primary forensic artifact. The important detection insight: a missing or empty ~/.bash_history on a long-running server with active admin users is immediately suspicious. The /proc/<pid>/environ counter-move is powerful: even if an attacker unsets HISTFILE interactively, the live environment of their shell process retains HISTFILE=/dev/null or HISTSIZE=0, visible via /proc. This doesn't survive process death, making it a live-host-only signal. For obfuscation, ${IFS} substitution is the most common evasion because it requires no encoding - it replaces the space character used to separate flagged keywords, evading simple string-match detection. The correct defense is full auditd execve capture: the audit log records all command arguments before the shell processes them, so even obfuscated commands appear partially decoded in the log. Pair HISTFILE monitoring with auditd execve to close both the evidence-destruction and evasion gaps.",

        notes: "SUID binaries and Linux capabilities are the primary sudo-less privilege escalation paths on Linux. The key insight is that SUID execution doesn't look like privilege escalation at the process-creation level - it is a normal binary invocation. The signal is in process metadata: effective UID (euid) differs from real UID (ruid), meaning the binary ran with elevated privileges. Auditd SYSCALL records capture both uid and auid (audit UID = the original login UID), so a comparison reveals SUID execution. The GTFOBins site catalogs every Unix binary that can turn SUID into a shell, and the list is longer than most defenders expect: find, awk, vim, less, more, env, tee, and many more. Linux capabilities are the subtler variant - instead of the full SUID bit, a binary gets specific kernel capabilities (cap_setuid, cap_dac_override) that grant targeted but still dangerous privileges. Critically, these do not appear in ls -la permissions output and require getcap to discover. A python3 binary with cap_setuid+ep is functionally equivalent to SUID root but invisible to the standard SUID hunt command.",

        notes: "Python is included as its own execution row because it ships by default on virtually every Linux distribution, making it a reliable interpreter for attackers who can't count on their own tooling being present. The two highest-value patterns: python -c with socket or pty.spawn (the canonical Python reverse shell, and the standard 'upgrade to interactive TTY' step that follows a basic shell), and python running a script from /tmp, /dev/shm, or /var/tmp (dropped tooling). The pty.spawn pattern in particular is almost never legitimate and is extremely high-fidelity. As with the shell row, a python process spawned by a network-facing service points at RCE/webshell, and a python process whose /proc/<pid>/exe shows '(deleted)' is running fileless. One Python-specific persistence/execution wrinkle worth knowing: sitecustomize.py and usercustomize.py are auto-imported on every interpreter start, so a planted copy outside the standard library is both execution and persistence - check for those. Telemetry is the same stack as the shell row (auditd execve, Sysmon for Linux EID 1, Falco for containers). Baseline legitimate Python automation heavily - many infra tools (Ansible, salt, cloud agents, monitoring) are Python and will generate -c and subprocess activity; scope the suspicious-args rules to socket/pty/temp-path patterns rather than alerting on all python -c.",

        notes: "pty.spawn('/bin/bash') is the single most common Python command used in active Linux intrusions. It is the universal step taken immediately after gaining a non-interactive shell (from curl|bash, a webshell, or a cron payload) to upgrade it to fully interactive. Nearly every operator runs this exact command within the first few interactions of a new shell. It is such a strong signal that alerting on any invocation of python with pty.spawn in the arguments has near-zero false positive rate in production environments - there is essentially no legitimate production use case for python -c with pty.spawn. The socket + os.dup2 pattern that accompanies it creates a complete network-backed interactive shell: the attacker connects a socket to their C2, then duplicates the socket file descriptor over stdin (fd 0), stdout (fd 1), and stderr (fd 2), so all shell I/O flows through the socket. The pty allocation makes the session indistinguishable from SSH at the pseudo-terminal level.

        notes: "sitecustomize.py is a legitimate Python mechanism that executes automatically at every interpreter startup - it is designed for system administrators to customize the Python environment system-wide. An attacker with write access to this file gets code execution on every Python invocation on the host, regardless of which script is called or which user runs it. This is particularly dangerous in environments where Python is used in cron jobs, monitoring scripts, or system automation: backdoor code in sitecustomize.py runs with whatever privilege those scripts carry. The usercustomize.py variant is lower-privilege (no root needed, only affects current user) but easier to plant. The PYTHONSTARTUP variant is more limited - it fires only for interactive Python sessions, not scripted invocations - making it most useful for credential harvesting when administrators use the Python REPL. The .pth file technique is the most subtle: a .pth file with an import statement (supported in Python 2, via directory-based loading in Python 3) or an absolute path pointing to an attacker-controlled directory allows arbitrary module shadowing. Detection priority: file integrity monitoring on all Python site-packages directories, combined with package manager verification after any change - these directories should only change during dpkg/pip package installations.",

        notes: "Cron is both an execution and a persistence technique; this row focuses on detecting the abuse, and it pairs with the eventual Linux persistence coverage. The detection surface is broad because cron has many homes - the master /etc/crontab, drop-in files in /etc/cron.d, the script directories (/etc/cron.hourly|daily|weekly|monthly), per-user spools (/var/spool/cron on RHEL, /var/spool/cron/crontabs on Debian), and increasingly systemd .timer units which are the modern replacement and easy to overlook. Two detection angles: file modification on any of those locations (auditd watch rules keyed for easy searching, or Sysmon for Linux EID 11), and cron-spawned children that are suspicious (cron/crond as parent of a shell, python, curl, or a /tmp payload). The content tells are the same as elsewhere - curl/wget/base64, reverse shells, payloads in writable paths - plus the cron-specific @reboot directive favored for boot persistence. The proactive play is a full cron enumeration sweep across all users and all locations including systemd timers, flagging any entry that invokes a downloader, a shell, or a writable-path binary, and any crontab belonging to a service/nologin account that shouldn't have one. This needs auditd watch rules on the cron paths to catch reliably in real time - note that as a prerequisite.

Historical prevalence:

Active use today:

  - Some older APT toolkits include perl components

Perl webshell families:

TeamTNT (mul) - cloud/container threat actor;

Hildegard (mul) - cloud-targeted threat actor;
  kubectl exec into running pods for lateral movement

Siloscape (mul) - Windows container escaper but illustrates
  the container exec → host pivot pattern

Common attack vectors:
  1. Exposed Docker daemon API (port 2375, no TLS):
     docker -H tcp://target:2375 exec -it <id> /bin/sh
  2. Compromised host → docker exec into app container
  3. kubectl exec via compromised service account token
  4. nsenter from host into container PID namespace
     (requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root on host)

Privileged container escape:
  docker run --privileged → nsenter --target 1
  --mount --pid --net gives full host access
  mount /dev/<disk> /mnt && chroot /mnt  (host FS access)

Detection gap:
  docker exec does not generate an auditd execve event

    - resources: [pods/exec]
      verbs: [create]
  Feed to SIEM for kubectl exec alerting

Elastic:
- Container Shell Execution
- Kubernetes Pod Exec

Wazuh:
  Docker integration module logs exec events
  Configure active response on exec + shell pattern

auditd (host-side):
  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve \\
    -F path=/usr/bin/docker -k docker_exec
  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve \\
    -F path=/usr/bin/nsenter -k nsenter_exec
  ausearch -k docker_exec --start today | grep exec

  Custom VQL for docker exec events`,
        notes: "Container administration exec commands (docker exec, kubectl exec, nsenter) are legitimate DevOps tools that also serve as primary lateral movement and post-exploitation mechanisms in containerized environments. The detection challenge is distinguishing authorized administrator use from attacker use: both generate identical process artifacts. Context is the key discriminator - alert on docker exec spawning a shell (bash/sh/dash) outside of expected maintenance windows, from unexpected source IPs or users, or targeting containers that should not have interactive sessions (databases, queue workers, monitoring agents). nsenter is especially powerful for attackers on the host: it allows entering a container's namespaces directly using the container's PID, bypassing the container runtime entirely, and requires only root or CAP_SYS_ADMIN on the host. The most dangerous scenario for detection purposes is a privileged container: any host-side exec into a privileged container, combined with nsenter --target 1 inside it, achieves full host root access. Falco provides the best real-time detection for container-side shell spawn; the Kubernetes audit log is the authoritative source for kubectl exec events.",
