The mechanism: fodhelper.exe is auto-elevating (autoElevate=true in its manifest) and, when launched, queries HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\Shell\\Open\\command to decide what to run - HKCU is user-writable, so an attacker plants their command there and fodhelper runs it elevated. The DelegateExecute empty-string trick forces the older Open\\command path to be honored. Detection is reliable because legitimate software essentially never writes to the ms-settings class handler under HKCU. The strongest single signal is the registry write to that path; the second-best is an auto-elevating binary (fodhelper/computerdefaults/sdclt/slui) spawning cmd/powershell/rundll32. Correlate the two and false positives are near zero. Note that UAC bypass is NOT a privilege boundary Microsoft commits to defend - they treat it as a convenience feature - so these techniques persist version to version with new auto-elevating binaries replacing patched ones.

First, the mock trusted directory: Windows path normalization strips trailing spaces, so 'C:\\Windows \\System32\\' (note the space after Windows) gets treated as the trusted System32 by the auto-elevation trust check, but the file open resolves to the attacker's spoofed folder. Any directory on disk with a trailing space is essentially always malicious. Second, DLL hijack of an auto-elevating binary: several auto-elevating system binaries (fodhelper, dccw, wsreset, slui, computerdefaults) load DLLs by relative or user-influenceable paths, so dropping a malicious proxy DLL where they look gets your code running at high integrity. Detection: hunt for unsigned DLLs loaded by the known auto-elevating binary set from AppData/Temp/Public, and scan the filesystem for trailing-space directories. Both signals are low-volume and high-fidelity. This technique overlaps heavily with DLL search-order hijack (T1574.001) - the difference is intent (elevation vs persistence/defense-evasion), not mechanism.",

The highest-value pattern by far is the 'Potato' chain: on servers running IIS or MSSQL, the service account (e.g. an app-pool identity) holds SeImpersonatePrivilege, and tools like PrintSpoofer/GodPotato/JuicyPotato coerce a SYSTEM process to authenticate over a named pipe or COM, then impersonate the resulting SYSTEM token - escalating service-account to SYSTEM in seconds. Hunt this two ways: (1) a process running as SYSTEM whose parent is not the normal service chain (services.exe/svchost/wininit/lsass/smss) - especially an interactive shell as SYSTEM with a weird parent; (2) Security 4672 special-privilege assignment combined with named-pipe creation from a service account. The cross-process EID 10 signals are noisier (legit tools touch lsass), so lead with the resulting-context anomaly rather than the API call. As a hardening pivot, enumerate which non-service processes hold SeImpersonate/SeAssignPrimaryToken - that's the attack surface for this entire technique.",

why it's used to evade CreateRemoteThread-based detection.

The operational reason matters for hunting - it specifically exists to avoid Sysmon EID 8, which is the highest-fidelity injection signal most defenders rely on. So the detection inverts: hunt for the OpenThread/OpenProcess with THREAD_SET_CONTEXT + SUSPEND_RESUME rights (EID 10), ideally correlated with a PROCESS_VM_WRITE to the same target and the ABSENCE of any EID 8 to that process. That correlation is SIEM work, but the EID 10 set-context access leg is a usable starting filter on its own once you baseline debuggers (devenv, windbg, vsdbg) and EDR. Confirmation is the same as other injection: memory scanners (PE-sieve, Volatility malfind) find the injected executable region, and the hijacked thread's context points into it. Treat this as a must-have companion to the CreateRemoteThread row - an environment that only watches EID 8 has a blind spot exactly the shape of this technique.",

The trick: Windows enforces Driver Signature Enforcement, so attackers don't write their own kernel driver - they load a legitimately-signed but vulnerable one (RTCore64 from MSI Afterburner, Dell's dbutil, Gigabyte's gdrv, Intel's iqvw64e, etc.) and exploit its arbitrary kernel read/write primitive to disable protections, kill EDR from kernel space, or elevate. Because the driver is validly signed, signature checks pass - so detection must be name/hash-based against a vulnerable-driver list (loldrivers.io and Microsoft's blocklist are the references) plus path heuristics. The highest-fidelity signals: Sysmon EID 6 driver loads matching the known-vulnerable set OR loading from a user-writable path (legit drivers load from System32\\drivers), and System 7045 kernel-mode service installs. The strongest single hardening control is enabling Microsoft's Vulnerable Driver Blocklist (HVCI/WDAC), which blocks the known-bad drivers outright. Operationally, a BYOVD load is rarely benign on an endpoint - any .sys from AppData/Temp, or any load matching the vuln list, warrants immediate investigation, since the next step is usually EDR being blinded right before ransomware detonates.",

Supplement with named-pipe creation (EID 17/18) by a service account right before the SYSTEM child, and enumerate SeImpersonate holders as your attack surface.

        notes: "PwnKit (CVE-2021-4034) is among the most consequential Linux local privilege escalation vulnerabilities ever disclosed: it affects the SUID-root pkexec binary present by default on nearly every Linux desktop and a large fraction of servers, it requires no special preconditions, and the exploit is trivially reliable with no crash. Disclosed by Qualys in January 2022, it was weaponized within hours and is now a standard tool in post-initial-access escalation. The exploitation primitive abuses pkexec's argument handling combined with GCONV_PATH environment manipulation to load an attacker-controlled shared object as root. The two highest-value detection signals are: a root shell whose parent process is pkexec invoked from a non-root session, and GCONV_PATH pointing to a writable directory in a process environment. Auditd execve capture comparing auid (login UID) against the resulting uid=0 is the most reliable telemetry. The primary control is patching - verify polkit is at the fixed version - but because pkexec is legitimately used, behavioral detection of the escalation pattern catches both PwnKit and the companion CVE-2021-3560 auth bypass.",

        notes: "Kernel and glibc local privilege escalation exploits are the second major Linux root path after pkexec/sudo abuse, and they are particularly relevant in environments with infrequent patching - legacy RHEL, embedded systems, and OT-adjacent Linux. Unlike pkexec abuse, kernel exploits are version-locked: the specific CVE that works depends on the exact kernel or glibc version, which is why attacker tooling (linux-exploit-suggester, LinPEAS) starts by mapping uname -r to applicable CVEs. This version-dependence is also a defender's advantage - knowing your kernel and glibc versions tells you precisely which exploits apply. The detection challenge is that the exploitation itself happens in kernel space and is hard to observe directly; the reliable signals are the outcomes and side effects: DirtyPipe and DirtyCOW typically modify /etc/passwd or overwrite a SUID binary (catch via file integrity monitoring on those targets by non-package-manager processes), Looney Tunables leaves a distinctive GLIBC_TUNABLES environment string, and most netfilter kernel LPEs require unprivileged user namespace creation (unshare -r) which can be disabled outright via sysctl. The single most valuable control beyond patching is file integrity monitoring on /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and all SUID binaries, combined with auditd setuid syscall capture to flag processes reaching uid=0 without traversing su/sudo/sshd.",

The precondition is that a non-admin user holds SetValue/WriteKey on a service's registry key (or has write access to the service binary itself - see the file-permissions row). When that's true, the attacker rewrites ImagePath (or ServiceDll for svchost-hosted services, or FailureCommand) to point at their payload, then triggers a restart - and the Service Control Manager launches it as the service account, almost always LocalSystem. The detection that matters most: Sysmon EID 13 writes to a Services\\*\\ImagePath|ServiceDll|FailureCommand value by anything other than services.exe/TrustedInstaller/msiexec/a known installer, especially when the new value points at AppData/Temp or an interpreter. Correlate with a subsequent service-start (7036 'running' or an EID 1 child of services.exe).

        notes: "Unquoted service path is a textbook Windows LPE that still appears constantly on third-party software. The vulnerability: a service's ImagePath is stored without quotes and contains spaces (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\Some App\\svc.exe), so the SCM tries each space-delimited prefix in turn - C:\\Program.exe, then C:\\Program Files\\Some.exe, then the real path. If a low-priv user can write a file at one of those intercept points (C:\\ root is writable by Authenticated Users on a surprising number of systems), it executes first as the service account - almost always SYSTEM. Detection has two clean signals: (1) the candidate set is enumerable - services with unquoted, space-containing paths outside C:\\Windows; (2) the exploitation is a file drop at an intercept point (C:\\Program.exe or C:\\Program Files\\<word>.exe) followed by services.exe launching a binary from a drive root or truncation point as SYSTEM. That services.exe-child-from-a-weird-path pattern is the smoking gun and is very low-FP. The hardening fix is trivial (quote the ImagePath, or fix the directory ACL), which is why proactive enumeration with PowerUp/WinPEAS is the right defensive posture - find and fix them before an attacker does.",

The vulnerable configuration is a permission, not a value:

Escalation preconditions (either is sufficient):
1. The service EXE itself is writable by a non-admin
   -> attacker overwrites it, restarts the service,
      their code runs as the service account (SYSTEM)
2. The service's FOLDER is writable by a non-admin
   -> attacker plants a DLL the service loads (search
      order / known-DLL) OR replaces the exe
3. A DLL the service depends on lives in a writable dir

On-disk artifacts:
- A service exe with a recent modified-time written by a

- An unsigned/odd DLL in a service's program folder

Three variants share this row - (1) the service EXE itself is writable, so the attacker overwrites it; (2) the service's folder is writable, so the attacker plants a DLL the service loads (a DLL search-order hijack landing in a SYSTEM process); (3) a dependency DLL lives in a writable location. All three end the same way: at the next service start the SCM runs the service as LocalSystem and the attacker's code executes as SYSTEM. The precondition is enumerable - non-admin Write/Modify/FullControl on a service exe or its directory (accesschk -quvw, PowerUp Get-ModifiableServiceFile). The runtime detection: a non-installer process writing to a Program Files .exe that belongs to a service, an unsigned DLL loaded by a services.exe child, or a SYSTEM service binary whose signature suddenly mismatches the vendor original. Lead with the signature/modified-time anomaly on SYSTEM service binaries - it's high fidelity.

        notes: "SID-History injection is a high-impact domain privilege escalation that doubles as stealthy persistence, so it belongs in the priv-esc set even though it's directory-centric rather than pure host. The sIDHistory attribute legitimately exists to support domain migrations (an account keeps its old SIDs so it retains access during a move). Attackers abuse it by injecting a privileged SID - Domain Admins (RID 512), Enterprise Admins (519) - into a normal account's sIDHistory; Windows then honors those rights at every logon, transparently, so the account wields DA without ever appearing in the Domain Admins group. That invisibility to group-membership audits is exactly what makes it dangerous. Three injection routes: mimikatz sid::add (needs DA already - so it's persistence after escalation), DSInternals offline NTDS editing, and DCShadow (lsadump::dcshadow) which registers a rogue DC and writes the attribute via replication to evade normal directory-change logging. Detection priorities: (1) DC Security 4765 (SID History added) and 4766 (failed attempt) - direct signals; (2) periodic enumeration of every account with non-empty sIDHistory, validating each against real migration records - on a single-domain forest sIDHistory should essentially be empty; (3) 4662 with DRSUAPI replication GUIDs from a non-DC for the DCShadow variant. Microsoft Defender for Identity detects both the injection and DCShadow natively and is the strongest single control if you have it.

Either way, triggering the accessibility hotkey at the lock screen spawns the shell in winlogon's SYSTEM context. Detection is high-fidelity on all three legs: (1) any write to a System32 accessibility binary by something other than TrustedInstaller, or a signature/modified-time anomaly on those specific binaries; (2) ANY IFEO Debugger value on an accessibility exe (essentially never legitimate); (3) the runtime payoff - winlogon.exe spawning cmd/powershell, which is never normal.

        notes: "IFEO injection is a flexible trigger primitive used for both privilege escalation and persistence, and it shares mechanism with two other rows (the accessibility backdoor's IFEO variant and the run-key IFEO Debugger noted in persistence) - so this row focuses on the general technique and the stealthier SilentProcessExit variant. The Debugger value is the classic form: setting Image File Execution Options\\<target>\\Debugger = payload causes Windows to launch the payload whenever <target> runs, with the original as an argument. Point it at a SYSTEM service binary or a frequently-run app and you have escalation and/or persistence. The SilentProcessExit variant is sneakier and exit-triggered: GlobalFlag = 0x200 plus a SilentProcessExit\\<target>\\MonitorProcess value makes WerFault launch the payload when the target process exits - easy to miss because it fires on exit, not launch, and lives under a less-watched key. Detection is enumerable and high-fidelity: list every IFEO Debugger value and validate against the short allowlist of real debuggers (vsjitdebugger, windbg, vsdebugger); list every SilentProcessExit MonitorProcess (almost never legitimate); and watch Sysmon EID 13 writes to both key families in real time.

Windows DLL search order (simplified, safe-mode on):
1. The directory of the loading EXE
2. System32, then System (16-bit), then Windows dir

- The attacker can write to a directory searched before
  the legitimate DLL (the EXE's own folder if writable,

Phantom DLL hijack (a common variant):
- The privileged process tries to load a DLL that does
  NOT exist on the system (a known set of phantom DLLs).
- Attacker drops that DLL in a searched, writable path.
- Procmon 'NAME NOT FOUND' on a DLL load by a SYSTEM

        notes: "DLL search-order hijacking and side-loading appear in execution (T1129) framing already, so this row is deliberately the privilege-escalation angle: the hijack lands in a process that runs at higher integrity or as SYSTEM, so the attacker inherits that context. The escalation precondition is the combination of (a) a privileged process loading a DLL by name rather than full path, and (b) a directory searched before the legitimate DLL that the attacker can write to - most often the privileged EXE's own folder when it has weak ACLs, or a 'phantom' DLL the process probes for but that doesn't exist on the system. The single highest-value detection is a SYSTEM-context process loading an unsigned DLL from a user-writable path (AppData/Temp/ProgramData/a writable program folder) - that pattern is rarely legitimate and catches both classic and phantom hijacks. Pair the EID 7 load signal with the EID 11 drop (a non-installer writing a .dll into a privileged program folder or System dir). Proactive hunting mirrors the attacker's recon: enumerate writable directories of SYSTEM-service binaries (the precondition), and use Procmon/Spartacus to find phantom-DLL targets before an adversary does.

        notes: "GPO modification is one of the most powerful domain privilege-escalation primitives because a single edit propagates SYSTEM-level execution or local-admin membership to every host the GPO applies to, at the next policy refresh. The two artifact surfaces are SYSVOL (the policy files - GptTmpl.inf for group membership and user rights, ScheduledTasks.xml for tasks including the fire-once ImmediateTaskV2, Groups.xml for local group pushes, Scripts\\Startup for SYSTEM scripts) and the directory object (the groupPolicyContainer's versionNumber and gPCMachineExtensionNames, which must update for clients to process the change). Detection should cover both: file-modify events on SYSVOL policy files (EID 11 / file auditing), especially any ImmediateTaskV2 which is almost always malicious, and Security 5136 directory-change events on GPO objects and their extension-name attributes. The strongest proactive control is auditing GPO write/link delegation - it's frequently over-granted, and BloodHound maps exactly who can edit or link which GPOs (the WriteGPLink/GenericWrite-on-GPO edges that SharpGPOAbuse weaponizes). This needs SYSVOL file auditing and Directory Service Changes auditing enabled on DCs to catch reliably - flag that as a prerequisite. Defender for Identity detects this natively at the directory level and is the strongest single control if available.

- trustedDomain objects under
  CN=System,DC=<domain> - a new or modified TDO
- Trust attributes: trustDirection, trustType,
  trustAttributes (e.g. enabling SID-history across the
  trust by clearing quarantine / SID-filtering)
- Security events: 4706 (new trust), 4707 (removed),
  4716/4865/4866/4867 (trust info changed)

Federation (Golden SAML / cloud) artifacts:
- AD FS relying-party trust additions/changes
- Token-signing certificate export or replacement (the
  key enabler for forging SAML tokens = Golden SAML)
- Cloud: Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings altering the
  IssuerUri / signing cert for a federated domain

Why it's high-impact:
- Disabling SID filtering on a trust lets injected
  SID-history (see T1134.005) escalate ACROSS domains
- A forged federation trust / stolen token-signing cert
  lets an attacker mint authentication tokens for ANY
  user (incl. admins) - persistent, cross-tenant access

Investigation pivots:
- Enumerate all trusts; validate each is expected and has
  SID filtering / quarantine intact
- On ADFS: monitor token-signing cert lifecycle and
  relying-party trust changes closely
- Pairs with T1134.005 SID-History for cross-domain escal.`,

        notes: "Domain trust modification is the heavier, less-common sibling of GPO abuse and it's included to complete T1484 - it's a domain/forest/tenant-level escalation and persistence primitive rather than an endpoint technique. Two flavors. On-prem: creating or altering a trusted domain object, notably weakening SID filtering / quarantine on a trust so that injected SID-history (T1134.005) is honored across domains - turning a single-domain compromise into forest-wide rights. Federation: the Golden SAML family - stealing or replacing the AD FS token-signing certificate, or repointing a federated domain's settings (Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings), lets an attacker forge SAML tokens for arbitrary users including admins, granting persistent cross-tenant access that survives password resets and MFA. Detection is identity-layer-centric: Security 4706/4707/4716 for on-prem trust changes, 5136 directory changes on trustedDomain objects, and federation cmdlet execution (Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings, Set-AdfsRelyingPartyTrust) on ADFS/admin hosts. The strongest controls are monitoring the AD FS token-signing certificate lifecycle and enumerating/baselining all trusts with SID filtering intact. Microsoft Defender for Identity and Defender for Cloud Apps detect both on-prem trust abuse and Golden SAML natively. As with GPO abuse, this is post-escalation domain-dominance tradecraft and requires directory/federation auditing to catch - note that prerequisite.

        notes: "Escape to host completes the TA0004 set and is increasingly relevant as workloads containerize - though it's worth being upfront that this Windows-host kit's Sysmon/PowerShell/registry telemetry only partially covers it. Most container escapes are misconfiguration rather than exploit: a privileged container (--privileged), host namespace sharing (--pid/--net=host), a sensitive host filesystem mount, or - the big one - the container runtime socket (/var/run/docker.sock) mounted inside a container, which is trivial full host takeover since the container can then create a new privileged container mounting host root. The right telemetry for this lives at the container/runtime layer: Falco is the de-facto runtime detector (privileged container launch, docker.sock access, sensitive host mounts, in-container shells), eBPF tools (Tracee/Tetragon) catch the syscall-level escape, and Kubernetes admission control (OPA Gatekeeper/Kyverno, Pod Security Standards) blocks the misconfigurations outright. On a Windows container host, the docker named-pipe access pattern is visible in Sysmon EID 1; on Linux hosts, auditd/Sysmon-for-Linux watching the docker socket and for nsenter/unshare/capsh from container PIDs is the play. The highest-value defensive posture is preventative: inventory containers/pods for the privileged flag, host namespaces, host mounts, and socket exposure - those preconditions are enumerable and fixing them eliminates the overwhelming majority of escapes. I've included the host-side signals this kit can express and pointed clearly at the container-native tooling (Falco/eBPF/admission control) that owns the rest, rather than overstating what Sysmon alone covers here.",

Privileged container (--privileged):

Mounted docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock):
  Container can control the host Docker daemon:
    docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock run -v /:/host ...
  Spawns a new privileged container mounting host root.

  --net=host    : host network stack access
  --ipc=host    : host shared memory
  Check: .HostConfig.PidMode/NetworkMode/IpcMode = "host"

Dangerous capabilities (without full --privileged):
  CAP_SYS_ADMIN  : mount, many escape paths
  CAP_SYS_PTRACE : ptrace host processes (with pid=host)
  CAP_SYS_MODULE : load kernel module → full host control
  CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH : read any host file (Shocker attack)
  Check: capsh --print  (from inside container)

Host filesystem mounts:

  This is the #1 misconfiguration exploited in the wild.

Docker socket escape:
  Mounted /var/run/docker.sock = host root equivalent.
  Attacker runs a new container mounting / with full caps.
  Extremely common in CI/CD containers and dev setups.

CAP_SYS_ADMIN / capability escapes:
  Even without --privileged, CAP_SYS_ADMIN enables mounting

Hardening / prevention (primary controls):

        notes: "Privileged containers and mounted Docker sockets are the two most exploited container escape paths, and both are misconfigurations rather than vulnerabilities - meaning they are entirely preventable but extremely common in real environments, especially CI/CD pipelines and developer setups. A --privileged container can escape to host root in a single command by mounting the host disk and chrooting into it, or by using nsenter to enter PID 1's namespaces. A mounted /var/run/docker.sock is functionally equivalent to giving the container host root, because the container can instruct the host Docker daemon to spawn a new container mounting the entire host filesystem. The detection strategy operates at two levels: posture (inventory containers for --privileged, socket mounts, host namespace sharing, and dangerous capabilities like CAP_SYS_ADMIN - this is a configuration audit) and runtime (Falco is the definitive tool, with built-in rules for privileged container launch, sensitive mount detection, namespace changes via nsenter, and container drift). From the host side, if the host PID namespace can see container processes, the escape commands (nsenter --target 1, mount of host devices, chroot to mounted root) are directly observable. The strongest controls are preventive: Kubernetes Pod Security Standards or OPA/Kyverno policies that simply refuse to schedule escape-enabling pod specs.",

CVE-2019-5736 (runc overwrite):
  Vulnerable: runc < 1.0-rc7, Docker < 18.09.2
  Mechanism: malicious container image causes the host
    runc binary to be overwritten when an operator runs
    docker exec / attach into the container. Next runc
    use executes attacker code as root on the host.
  Artifact: /usr/bin/runc modified outside a package update
    (hash/mtime change is the definitive indicator)
  Targets: /usr/bin/runc, /usr/sbin/runc, docker-runc

cgroups v1 release_agent escape:
  Precondition: container with CAP_SYS_ADMIN (or privileged)
  Mechanism:
    1. mount -t cgroup -o rdma cgroup /tmp/cgrp
    2. echo 1 > /tmp/cgrp/x/notify_on_release
    3. echo "/path/to/payload" > /tmp/cgrp/release_agent
    4. trigger empty cgroup → kernel runs payload as ROOT on host
  Artifact: release_agent file containing a host path;
    notify_on_release set to 1; cgroup mount from container

cgroups v2:
  release_agent removed; this specific escape does not apply.
  Check: stat -fc %T /sys/fs/cgroup  (cgroup2fs = v2)

Detection priority:
  runc binary integrity monitoring (rpm -V / AIDE) - critical
  release_agent file monitoring across /sys/fs/cgroup
  Inventory containers with CAP_SYS_ADMIN / privileged

        tools: `runc / cgroups escape in the wild:

CVE-2019-5736 (runc):
  Disclosed Feb 2019. High-impact: overwrites host runc.
  Public PoCs immediately available. Requires an operator
  to exec into a malicious container, or attacker control
  of a container image + the ability to get it run.
  Notable because it turns "docker exec into a container"
  into host compromise.

CVE-2024-21626 (runc, "Leaky Vessels"):
  Jan 2024. WORKDIR / leaked file descriptor escape.
  Allows container build/run to access host filesystem.
  Public exploits; affects many runc versions.

cgroups release_agent escape:
  Not a CVE - a feature abuse requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
  Widely documented (Felix Wilhelm PoC is canonical).
  Works on any cgroups v1 host where a container has
  CAP_SYS_ADMIN. The classic "one-liner container escape."

Tooling:
  CDK, deepce, BOtB all automate release_agent escape
  and check for runc-version vulnerability.

Threat actor relevance:
  These are higher-skill escapes than privileged/socket
  misconfig, but the cgroups release_agent technique is
  simple enough that it appears in commodity container
  attack toolkits. CVE-2024-21626 saw rapid weaponization.

Why runc integrity matters:
  The runc binary is the single most security-critical
  file in a container host. Any change to it outside a
  controlled package update is a critical incident.`,

- file_event_lnx_cgroup_release_agent_write.yml
- proc_creation_lnx_cgroup_mount_container_escape.yml

Falco (built-in runtime detection):
  rule: Modify container entrypoint / runc binary
  rule: Write below /sys/fs/cgroup (release_agent abuse)
  rule: Detect release_agent File Container Escapes
  (Falco ships a dedicated release_agent escape rule)

Elastic detection rules:
- runc Binary Overwrite (CVE-2019-5736)
- cgroups release_agent Container Escape

File integrity (critical control):
  AIDE/Tripwire/Wazuh: monitor /usr/bin/runc with sha256
  Any change = critical, page immediately
  rpm -V runc / dpkg --verify runc in scheduled checks

Auditd:
  -w /usr/bin/runc -p wa -k runc_modify
  -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S mount -F fstype=cgroup -k cgroup_mount
  ausearch -k runc_modify | grep -v "comm=\\"dpkg\\"\\|comm=\\"rpm\\""

Patch verification (primary defense):
  runc --version  (need >= 1.1.12 for CVE-2024-21626)
  docker --version (>= 18.09.2 for CVE-2019-5736)

Prevention:
  - Drop CAP_SYS_ADMIN from all containers (blocks release_agent)
  - Use cgroups v2 (release_agent removed entirely)
  - Read-only host runc via immutable bit / verified boot
  - gVisor / Kata for runtime isolation`,
        notes: "The runc binary overwrite (CVE-2019-5736) and the cgroups release_agent escape represent the more sophisticated tier of container escape, beyond simple privileged/socket misconfiguration. CVE-2019-5736 is notable because it weaponizes a routine administrative action: when an operator runs docker exec into a malicious container, the container overwrites the host's runc binary, and the next invocation of runc executes attacker code as root on the host. This makes runc binary integrity the single most critical file-monitoring target on any container host - the runc binary should never change except during a controlled package update, so any modification is a critical incident warranting immediate response. The cgroups v1 release_agent escape is not a CVE but a feature abuse: a container with CAP_SYS_ADMIN can mount a cgroup hierarchy, set a release_agent path pointing to an attacker payload, and trigger it to execute as root on the host when a cgroup empties. The two preventive controls that eliminate this entire class are dropping CAP_SYS_ADMIN from containers (which removes the release_agent precondition) and migrating to cgroups v2, which removed the release_agent mechanism entirely. For detection, Falco ships a dedicated release_agent escape rule, and file integrity monitoring on /usr/bin/runc with SHA-256 is the essential complement. Track CVE-2024-21626 (Leaky Vessels) as the modern runc escape requiring updated patching.",

Second, dangerous user-right/privilege assignment - SeDebug (own any process -> SYSTEM), SeImpersonate (Potato -> SYSTEM), SeLoadDriver (BYOVD -> kernel), SeBackup/Restore, SeTakeOwnership - via 4704, often pushed through a GPO (ties to T1484.001). Third, AdminSDHolder/SDProp abuse - adding an ACE to CN=AdminSDHolder propagates control over every protected admin account hourly, a durable escalation-and-persistence combo, visible as a 5136 nTSecurityDescriptor change. Lead detection with crown-jewel group-membership monitoring and AdminSDHolder ACL change alerts - both are low-volume and extremely high-fidelity. BloodHound maps the AddMember/WriteDACL/GenericAll edges attackers use to perform these. This needs Security audit policy for group membership and Directory Service Changes enabled on DCs; Defender for Identity detects the group adds and AdminSDHolder manipulation natively. The line vs persistence is intent: here the account-rights change is the escalation step itself, not just a way back in.",

Reference: gtfobins.github.io (filter: SUID)`,
        tools: `SUID/SGID abuse - the foundational Linux LPE path:

Why it matters:
  SUID binaries run with the file owner's privileges
  (often root) regardless of who executes them. A SUID
  binary that can spawn a shell or write arbitrary files
  is an instant privilege escalation.

GTFOBins (gtfobins.github.io):
  The definitive catalog of Unix binaries abusable when
  SUID-set or sudo-allowed. Hundreds of entries. Both red
  and blue teams reference it constantly.

Enumeration tooling:
  LinPEAS / LinEnum   - automated SUID/SGID enumeration
  linux-smart-enum    - SUID + GTFOBins cross-reference
  GTFOBins lookup is built into most privesc scripts

Attacker workflow:
  1. find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
  2. Cross-reference results against GTFOBins
  3. Execute the GTFOBins escalation one-liner
  Often automated end-to-end by LinPEAS.

Persistence variant:
  Attacker who already has root drops a SUID-root copy of
  bash (chmod 4755 /tmp/.x) as a re-escalation backdoor.
  cp /bin/bash /tmp/.bd; chmod +s /tmp/.bd; /tmp/.bd -p

Threat actor use:
  Rocke, 8220, TeamTNT all enumerate SUID post-access.
  Web-shell → www-data → SUID perl/python = instant root
  on misconfigured legacy servers. Extremely common.

The detection approach has two halves: a static posture audit (enumerate all SUID/SGID binaries and compare against a known-good baseline - the legitimate set on a stock system is small, roughly su, sudo, passwd, chsh, chfn, newgrp, gpasswd, mount, umount, pkexec, fusermount, ping, so anything outside that set deserves scrutiny, and any SUID binary outside /usr, /bin, /sbin is highly suspicious), and a behavioral signal (auditd execve capture where the effective UID becomes 0 while the audit/login UID is non-zero, which precisely identifies a SUID-to-root transition). A common attacker persistence pattern that doubles as re-escalation is dropping a SUID-root copy of bash in /tmp - watch for root-owned SUID binaries in writable directories. This row is the privilege-escalation counterpart to the SUID execution row on the Execution page; the distinguishing signal here is the euid transition to root.",

Dangerous capabilities and their escalation paths:

    python3: os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")
  cap_dac_override+ep : bypass file permission checks
    read /etc/shadow, write /etc/passwd
  cap_dac_read_search+ep : read any file (Shocker-style)
  cap_sys_admin+ep : mount, many escape paths (near-root)
  cap_sys_ptrace+ep : ptrace any process → inject into root proc
  cap_sys_module+ep : load kernel module → total host control
  cap_chown+ep / cap_fowner+ep : change ownership of files
  cap_net_admin / cap_net_raw : network manipulation

Expected-legitimate capability holders (baseline):
  /usr/bin/ping            cap_net_raw   (or SUID on some distros)
  /usr/sbin/arping         cap_net_raw
  /usr/bin/mtr-packet      cap_net_raw
  (cap_setuid, cap_dac_override, cap_sys_admin on a file
   are almost never legitimate on a normal server)

Setting a capability (the attack/persistence act):
  setcap cap_setuid+ep /usr/bin/python3
  Then any user runs: python3 -c 'import os;os.setuid(0);os.system("/bin/sh")'

Why this is stealthy:
  find -perm -4000 does NOT show capability-enabled binaries.
  Only getcap reveals them. Many defenders never check.
  A cap_setuid python3 is functionally SUID-root but invisible
  to the standard SUID hunt.`,
        tools: `Linux capabilities abuse:

The stealthy cousin of SUID:
  Capabilities split root's power into ~40 distinct units.
  setcap assigns specific capabilities to a binary file.
  A binary with cap_setuid+ep can become root, but it does
  NOT show up in find -perm -4000. This invisibility makes
  it a favored persistence + escalation mechanism.

Most dangerous for escalation:
  cap_setuid    - direct path to root (setuid(0) + exec shell)
  cap_dac_override / cap_dac_read_search - read/write any file
  cap_sys_admin - the "new root"; enables mount + many escapes
  cap_sys_ptrace - inject into privileged processes
  cap_sys_module - load a malicious kernel module = game over

Enumeration tooling:
  LinPEAS    - dedicated capabilities section, flags dangerous ones
  getcap -r / - the core command; attackers run it first
  linux-smart-enumeration - capability + GTFOBins cross-ref

GTFOBins has a Capabilities filter:
  gtfobins.github.io - filter by "Capabilities" shows which
  binaries escalate with which capability set

Persistence angle:
  An attacker with root sets cap_setuid+ep on a benign-looking
  binary, then drops to a low-priv user. Re-escalation is one
  command and leaves no SUID artifact. Survives many cleanups.

Container relevance:
  Container capabilities (capsh --print) determine escape
  surface. CAP_SYS_ADMIN in a container = likely escapable.
  See T1611 for the container escape chains these enable.

  Less common than SUID in commodity malware (because it's
  less universally understood), but documented in targeted
  Linux intrusions and increasingly in container attacks.`,

        notes: "Linux capabilities are the stealthy counterpart to SUID and represent a frequently-missed escalation and persistence vector precisely because they are invisible to the standard SUID hunt (find -perm -4000). Capabilities split root's monolithic power into roughly 40 distinct units, and the setcap command assigns specific ones to a binary file. A binary with cap_setuid+ep can call setuid(0) and become root - functionally identical to SUID-root - but it does not appear in any permission-based search; only getcap -r / reveals it. This invisibility is exactly why it appeals to attackers for persistence: an attacker with root can grant cap_setuid+ep to a benign-looking binary, drop to a low-privilege account, and retain a one-command re-escalation path that survives cleanups focused on SUID binaries and cron jobs. The most dangerous capabilities for escalation are cap_setuid (direct root), cap_dac_override and cap_dac_read_search (read/write any file, including /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd), cap_sys_admin (the de facto new root, enabling mount and numerous escape paths), cap_sys_ptrace (inject into privileged processes), and cap_sys_module (load a malicious kernel module for total control). The single most important detection control is running getcap -r / on a schedule and diffing against a known-good baseline - on a normal server the legitimate capability set is tiny (typically just cap_net_raw on ping and a few network tools), so cap_setuid, cap_dac_override, or cap_sys_admin on any file is almost always worth investigating.

The #1 real-world Linux LPE in CTFs and pentests:
  Overly-permissive sudoers rules are extremely common.
  The workflow is universal:
    1. sudo -l        (what can I run?)
    2. Cross-reference allowed commands with GTFOBins
    3. Execute the escalation one-liner

GTFOBins (gtfobins.github.io):
  "Sudo" filter lists every binary that escalates to root
  when sudo-allowed. Hundreds of entries: editors, pagers,
  interpreters, archivers, even seemingly-harmless tools.

Common dangerous grants seen in the wild:
  systemctl, apt, dpkg, git, tar, zip, vim, find, less,
  python, perl, awk, nmap, man, env, tee, dd, cp

env_keep / LD_PRELOAD passthrough:
  If sudoers preserves LD_PRELOAD, an attacker preloads a
  malicious .so that runs as root via any allowed sudo command.

Tooling:
  sudo -l        - the attacker's first command
  LinPEAS        - parses sudo -l, flags GTFOBins matches
  sudo_killer    - dedicated sudo misconfig + CVE exploitation
  GTFOBins lookup is built into every privesc script

Threat actor use:
  Less "APT signature," more universal opportunism. Any
  actor with a foothold runs sudo -l. Cryptomining crews,
  red teams, and manual intruders all exploit sudo misconfig
  as the path of least resistance to root.

        notes: "Sudoers misconfiguration is the single most common real-world Linux privilege escalation path - more prevalent than kernel exploits or pkexec because it requires no vulnerability, just an overly-permissive policy that administrators create routinely for convenience. The attacker workflow is universal and is the first thing run after any foothold: sudo -l to enumerate allowed commands, cross-reference against GTFOBins, and execute the escalation one-liner. The danger is that many seemingly-reasonable sudo grants are exploitable: allowing a user to run vim, find, less, awk, python, systemctl, apt, git, or tar via sudo grants effective root, because all of those binaries can spawn a shell or write arbitrary files from within their privileged execution. NOPASSWD rules compound the risk by removing even the password barrier. A subtler vector is env_keep: if sudoers preserves LD_PRELOAD or PYTHONPATH, an attacker can preload a malicious shared object that executes as root through any allowed sudo command. The detection approach is primarily configuration audit - regularly enumerate each user's sudo rights (sudo -l -U), flagging NOPASSWD entries, GTFOBins-exploitable commands, wildcards, and env_keep directives - supplemented by behavioral detection of sudo invoking editors or interpreters followed by a root shell.

Baron Samedit (CVE-2021-3156):
  Heap-based buffer overflow in sudo's command-line parsing.
  Affects sudo 1.8.2 - 1.8.31p2 and 1.9.0 - 1.9.5p1.
  Fixed in sudo 1.9.5p2 (Jan 2021).
  Trigger: sudoedit -s with a trailing backslash.
  Reliable, no-auth root. Affects default installs widely.
  Artifact: sudo/sudoedit segfault in dmesg/kern.log;
    sudoedit -s invocations with backslash args.

CVE-2019-14287 (runas user-ID bypass):
  sudo < 1.8.28. If a user is allowed to run a command as
  any user EXCEPT root (e.g. user ALL=(ALL,!root) ...),
  they can bypass with:  sudo -u#-1 <cmd>  (resolves to 0).
  Artifact: sudo invoked with -u#-1 or -u#4294967295.

CVE-2023-22809 (sudoedit arbitrary file write):
  sudo 1.8.0 - 1.9.12p1. EDITOR/SUDO_EDITOR injection with
  extra file argument allows editing arbitrary files as root.
  Artifact: EDITOR env containing "-- /etc/sudoers" style args.

Sudo token / timestamp reuse:
  /run/sudo/ts/<user>   - sudo credential cache timestamp
  When valid (default 15 min), sudo runs without re-prompting.
  Attack: inject (ptrace) into a process owned by a user with
    a valid timestamp, then run sudo - no password needed.
  Tools: sudo_inject, "sudo token" exploitation.
  Artifact: ptrace of a shell process + subsequent sudo;
    manipulation of /run/sudo/ts/ files.

Baron Samedit (CVE-2021-3156):
  Qualys, Jan 2021. One of the most impactful sudo bugs.
  Heap overflow reachable by any local user (no sudo rights
  required at all). Public exploits within hours. Reliable
  root on a huge range of distros. Still found unpatched on
  legacy and OT-adjacent systems.

CVE-2019-14287 (runas bypass):
  The "-u#-1" bug. Only relevant when a sudoers rule allows
  running as any user except root - the bypass turns "not
  root" into root via integer wraparound. Simple, no exploit
  binary needed - just a sudo command-line trick.

CVE-2023-22809 (sudoedit):
  EDITOR variable injection allows editing arbitrary files
  (like /etc/sudoers or /etc/shadow) as root via sudoedit.

Sudo token reuse (not a CVE - design abuse):
  sudo caches credentials for ~15 min in /run/sudo/ts/.
  If an attacker controls a process owned by a user who
  recently sudo'd, they can ptrace-inject and reuse the
  cached token - root with no password.
  Tooling: sudo_inject (github), "sudo token" technique.

Enumeration/exploitation tooling:
  sudo_killer     - detects vulnerable sudo + misconfig
  LinPEAS         - flags sudo version against CVEs
  linux-exploit-suggester - maps sudo version to CVEs

Threat actor use:
  Baron Samedit was rapidly adopted by cryptomining crews
  and is a staple in commodity Linux LPE toolchains. Token
  reuse is more targeted/manual but documented in hands-on
  intrusions.

        notes: "Sudo binary vulnerabilities complement sudoers misconfiguration as a root path, and Baron Samedit (CVE-2021-3156) is the standout: a heap-based buffer overflow in sudo's argument parsing that any local user can trigger with no sudo rights whatsoever, fixed only in sudo 1.9.5p2 (January 2021). It is reliable, leaves a segfault trace in kernel logs when exploitation is attempted, and remains unpatched on many legacy and OT-adjacent systems where sudo is rarely updated - making version verification the primary control. CVE-2019-14287 is a narrower but elegant bug: when a sudoers rule grants a user the right to run a command as any user except root (a pattern administrators sometimes use thinking it is safe), the user can specify -u#-1, which wraps around to UID 0, bypassing the restriction with nothing more than a command-line trick. Sudo token reuse is a design-level abuse rather than a CVE: sudo caches credentials for roughly 15 minutes in /run/sudo/ts/, so an attacker who controls a process owned by a user with a valid timestamp can ptrace-inject into it and run sudo without a password. The two most effective hardening controls beyond patching are setting kernel.yama.ptrace_scope to 1 or higher (which blocks the ptrace injection underlying token reuse) and setting timestamp_timeout=0 in sudoers (which disables credential caching entirely). For detection, watch for sudo invoked with -u#-1 or -u#4294967295, sudo/sudoedit segfaults in kernel logs, and ptrace of shell processes followed by sudo execution.",

Escalation vectors (distinct from execution-side T1106):

1. sudo env_keep LD_PRELOAD passthrough:
   /etc/sudoers with: Defaults env_keep += "LD_PRELOAD"
   Attack: LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/evil.so sudo <allowed-cmd>
   The .so's constructor runs as root.
   Artifact: env_keep LD_PRELOAD in sudoers; .so in /tmp.

2. /etc/ld.so.preload affecting SUID binaries:
   Any .so listed loads into EVERY process - including
   SUID-root binaries. So a low-priv attacker who can write
   ld.so.preload (or already has root and wants persistence)
   gets code execution in root context.
   Artifact: /etc/ld.so.preload exists (should not on clean host).

3. Writable directory in library search path:
   /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*.conf listing a writable dir, OR a
   SUID binary with RPATH/RUNPATH pointing to a writable path.
   Attacker drops a malicious lib with a name the binary loads.
   Artifact: writable dir in ld.so.conf paths; RPATH to /tmp etc.

4. RPATH/RUNPATH hijack on SUID binaries:
   readelf -d <suid_binary> | grep RPATH
   If RPATH is writable, drop a matching .so name there.

Inspection commands:
  ldd <binary>              - libraries a binary loads
  readelf -d <binary>       - RPATH/RUNPATH entries
  cat /etc/ld.so.conf.d/*   - configured search paths
  /proc/<pid>/maps          - libs actually mapped in a process

Relationship to T1106:
  T1106 (Execution) covers LD_PRELOAD for general code exec
  and userland rootkits (Ebury, Azazel). This row is the
  privilege-escalation framing: loading attacker code into a
  PRIVILEGED (root/SUID/sudo) process specifically to escalate.`,
        tools: `Dynamic linker hijacking for escalation:

The privesc-specific framing:
  LD_PRELOAD/LD_LIBRARY_PATH are normally stripped for SUID
  binaries (the linker ignores them for setuid programs - a
  deliberate security measure). So the escalation paths are
  the cases where that protection does NOT apply:

  a) sudo with env_keep += LD_PRELOAD - the sudoers admin
     explicitly preserved it, re-opening the hole. Common
     misconfiguration. Attacker preloads .so → root.
  b) /etc/ld.so.preload - a SYSTEM-WIDE preload file that
     applies even to SUID binaries (it is not the LD_PRELOAD
     env var, so the setuid protection does not strip it).
  c) Writable RPATH/RUNPATH or ld.so.conf dir - the binary's
     own configured search path includes a writable location.

Why SUID strips LD_PRELOAD (and why these bypass it):
  glibc ignores LD_PRELOAD/LD_LIBRARY_PATH from the environment
  for setuid binaries. But /etc/ld.so.preload is a file, not
  an env var, so it still applies. And sudo env_keep re-injects
  the env var into the privileged process explicitly.

Tooling:
  LinPEAS    - checks sudo env_keep, ld.so.preload, writable
               lib paths, and RPATH on SUID binaries
  GTFOBins   - notes which sudo-allowed binaries pair with
               LD_PRELOAD env_keep for escalation

Threat actor use:
  Ebury (the libssl LD_PRELOAD rootkit) is the famous example
  of linker abuse, though primarily for credential theft and
  persistence. The sudo env_keep LD_PRELOAD escalation is a
  classic CTF/pentest finding and appears in real misconfigs.

See T1106 (Execution) for the rootkit/code-exec framing of
the same mechanism.`,

  T1574.006 - dynamic linker hijacking tests`,
        notes: "Dynamic linker hijacking for privilege escalation is the privesc-focused framing of the LD_PRELOAD mechanism covered on the Execution page under T1106, and the distinction matters because of an important security control: glibc deliberately ignores the LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables for SUID binaries, precisely to prevent trivial escalation. The escalation paths in this row are therefore the specific cases where that protection does not apply. First and most common is sudo with env_keep += LD_PRELOAD: when a sudoers rule explicitly preserves LD_PRELOAD, it re-injects the variable into the privileged process, so an attacker can preload a malicious shared object that executes as root through any allowed sudo command. Second is /etc/ld.so.preload, which is a file rather than an environment variable - the setuid protection does not strip it, so any library listed there loads into SUID-root processes, granting root-context code execution. Third is a writable directory in the library search path (via ld.so.conf or a SUID binary's RPATH/RUNPATH), where the attacker drops a library with a name the privileged binary loads. The primary controls are configuration audits: remove LD_PRELOAD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH from any sudoers env_keep directive, verify /etc/ld.so.preload does not exist, and check the RPATH/RUNPATH of SUID binaries for writable paths.
